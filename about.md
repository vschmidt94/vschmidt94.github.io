I enjoy building things, and I probably like taking things apart even more. My day job as a Software Development Engineer
lets me do both. In my spare time you'll find me in the garage working on my current project - rebuilding a '66 Mustang
or spending time with my family exploring Sacramento and the rest of NorCal.
