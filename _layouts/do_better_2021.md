# Do Better in 2021

These are possibly premature new year's resolutions... but some things I want to personally focus on for improvement in
the next year.  

Hopefully writing these down and maintaining this list will force me to keep these in mind for the coming year.

## On the job

### Read-Think-Plan (RTP)

I've been blocking out the first 30 minutes of the workday in my calendar for planning the day ahead, but what I really
do is turn on the computer already thinking about what I left off yesterday, and jumping right into whatever work is
sitting on the top of my head. I think having the discipline for a short, focused planning session would be beneficial.

### Get up and out

Another block I'm going to purposefully schedule during the workday is the "get off my ass and go take a walk" period.
Before WFH, I had a workday schedule that got me out of the chair a lot during the day - and I made the effort to leave
work with ~ 10k steps by the end of the day. Work from home killed that for me, so I need to focus on making it happen -
even from home.

### Write, Journal, and Document

Part of the motivation for moving blog to Jekyll+Github is the ability to be able to reduce the friction of capturing my
own thoughts. OneNote is probably the best suited for a work journal, and I'll continue using that as such - but for
other things, like this - I really like staying in a Vim editor and not focusing all that much on cosmetics. And it is
nice to be able to access at a moment's notice from any of my devices (which I can't do with OneNote due to security
restrictions on where that content can live).

### Level up in...

1. Typescript
2. Kubernetes
3. Go

## Off work

### Read more

I don't watch a lot of TV at all - but my list of books to read is only growing. Start working on the backlog.

### Code

Wait, I do that at work... Yep, but code produced at work tends towards reuse of the same patterns and designs. That, I
can feel my C language skills rusting. Start working on some challenges or other side project to keep fresh.

### Live healthier

Eat better. Exercise more. Be accountable.
